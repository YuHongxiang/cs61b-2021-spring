Getting Java Libraries Remember the empty library-sp18 folder? We are going to populate that folder with the Java libraries we need for this class.

First, open up a terminal window and cd into your three-letter repository. Run 

git submodule update --init 

You should get output like this:

Submodule 'library-sp18' (https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/library-sp18.git) registered for path 'library-sp18' Cloning into '/Users/vivian/class/cs61b/viv/library-sp18'... Submodule path 'library-sp18': checked out '2bd75038edcf1ac7bacdb9e85fc08853153bd4e8' Ta-da! You now have libraries! $ ls library-sp18/ javalib/ Below is shown the directory structure of library-sp18. Look inside the folder and make sure you see the six .jar files listed below. If you’re using your operating system’s file explorer the ‘jar’ part might not show up in the filenames, and that’s OK.
